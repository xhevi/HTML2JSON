#HTML2JSON
This extension will try to generate a JSON object from the HTML of the page that is currently shown on the browser.

Why is it useful?
- JSON is easily readable and processable format of file
- For post processing of the HTML/DOM elements
- Part of my school projects

Please note that I'm a designer, not a developer, so my code is bad :) I do this stuff for fun. If you would like to contribute and help with the coding, contact  hi@xhevi.com
